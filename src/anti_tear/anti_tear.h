 * @brief
 * The anti-tear subsystem interface.
 * 
 * The anti-tear subsystem is responsible for reducing temporal tearing artifacts
 * in captured frames.
 * 
 * Generally, tearing artifacts occur when the capture device samples an image of
 * the input signal while the signal source is still in the process of drawing the
 * image. The captured frame will then consists of parts of new image data and
 * parts of old image data, with tears occurring where new and old parts meet.
 * 
 * The anti-tear subsystem takes as input a series of images and produces as
 * output a second, reduced series of images in which the input images' new parts
 * have been combined into un-torn images. For instance, if you input two
 * captured frames in which the top half of the first frame contains one half
 * of an image and the bottom half of the second frame contains the second half
 * of the image, the output will be one whole image.
 * 
 * The gist of the anti-tearing algorithm is that it first compares pixels in the
 * current input image against the pixels in the previous input image (scanning
 * pixels row by row) to find which areas of the image have changed, then
 * copies the new areas' pixels into a back buffer. The algorithm repeats itself
 * across successive input images until the back buffer contains a full de-torn
 * image. A major source of uncertainty in the algorithm comes from the fact
 * that captured frames may contain extraneous analog noise etc., making it less
 * obvious which parts of the image have changed from the previous one.
 * 
 * ## Usage
 * 
 *   1. Call kat_initialize_anti_tear() to initialize the subsystem.
 * 
 *   2. Call kat_anti_tear() with the image data on which you want to apply
 *      anti-tearing.
 * 
 *   3. Optionally, call any of the setter functions (@a kat_set_xxxx) to adjust the
 *      anti-tearer's operation.
 * 
 *   4. Call kat_release_anti_tear() to release the subsystem.
