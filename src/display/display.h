/*! @file
 *
 * @brief
 * The display subsystem interface.
 *
 * The VCS GUI is responsible for providing the user with real-time means to
 * enter information (e.g. configuring capture parameters), for directing such
 * input to VCS, and for displaying captured frames and other information about
 * VCS's run-time state to the user.
 *
 * The display interface decouples the GUI's implementation from the rest of
 * VCS, making it possible to replace the GUI with fairly minimal modification
 * to the rest of VCS.
 *
 * VCS's default GUI uses Qt, and its implementation of the display interface
 * can be found in @ref src/display/qt/d_main.cpp.
 *
 * @warning
 * As of VCS 2.0.0, this interface is undergoing refactoring. Many of its
 * functions are expected to become renamed or removed.
