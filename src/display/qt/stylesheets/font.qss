/* We want to allow certain elements of the program to retain the original
   system font - things like the menu bar. Ideally, we'd make all (*)
   elements use the custom font and then set the particular other elements
   to "font-style: initial", but that syntax doesn't appear supported in
   QSS at the time of writing. So let's just laboriously define all the
   specific elements that should have the custom font, leaving out the
   ones that should use the default font. This isn't ideal, but hey.
