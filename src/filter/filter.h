 * @brief
 * The filter subsystem interface.
 * 
 * The filter subsystem provides facilities for manipulating captured frames'
 * pixel data.
 * 
 * The building block of this subsystem is the image filter. They're subclasses of
 * abstract_filter_c that modify image pixels in some way: blurring, sharpening,
 * rotation, and so on.
 * 
 * Instances of image filters are organized into filter chains. A filter chain
 * consists of one or more filters, each of which will be applied in turn to an
 * input frame. A filter chain consisting of a blur filter, a sharpen filter, and
 * a rotation filter would first blur the frame, then sharpen it, and finally
 * rotate it.
 * 
 * Each filter chain is associated with an input condition and an output condition,
 * based on which the subsystem makes a choice about which of the chains to apply
 * to an input frame. A chain's input condition dictates the resolution the input
 * frame must be in to be acted on by the chain's filters, and the output condition
 * specifies the resolution the scaler subsystem must be outputting in for the
 * chain to be applied. The first filter chain whose input and output conditions
 * are fulfilled will be applied to the input frame.
 * 
 * For example, a filter chain with an input condition of 640 x 480 and an output
 * condition of 800 x 600 will be applied to an input frame if the frame's resolution
 * is 640 x 480 and the scaler subsystem is set to produce its output in 800 x 600
 * (i.e. it'll scale this frame to 800 x 600 at a later stage in VCS's capture
 * pipeline). If there's a second filter chain with these same conditions, only
 * the first chain will be applied and not the second.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   1. Call kf_initialize_filters() to initialize the filter subsystem. Note that
 *      this function should only be called once per program execution.
 *
 *   2. Use kf_create_filter_instance() to create instances of filters:
 *      @code
 *      // Create an instance of a blurring filter.
 *      auto *blur = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_blur_c>();
 * 
 *      // You can also use the non-templated instancer, which takes a UUID string
 *      // identifying the type of filter to create.
 *      auto *flip = kf_create_filter_instance("80a3ac29-fcec-4ae0-ad9e-bbd8667cc680");
 * 
 *      // "80a3ac29-fcec-4ae0-ad9e-bbd8667cc680" == filter_flip_c().uuid().
 *      @endcode
 * 
 *   3. Get and set filters' parameter values:
 *      @code
 *      auto *blur = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_blur_c>();
 * 
 *      // Increase the blurring radius.
 *      const double radius = blur->parameter(filter_blur_c::PARAM_KERNEL_SIZE);
 *      blur->set_parameter(filter_blur_c::PARAM_KERNEL_SIZE, (radius + 1));
 * 
 *      // Use a box kernel instead of the default Gaussian.
 *      blur->set_parameter(filter_blur_c::PARAM_TYPE, filter_blur_c::BLUR_BOX);
 * 
 *      // Note: Each filter also includes a GUI widget that provides the end-user graphical
 *      // controls for adjusting the filter parameters. VCS's display subsystem provides an
 *      // interactive filter graph that exposes these widgets to the user.
 *      @endcode
 *
 *   4. Combine filters into filter chains:
 *      @code
 *      // Create some filters.
 *      auto *blur = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_blur_c>();
 *      auto *flip = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_flip_c>();
 * 
 *      // Create the chain's input and output conditions. This chain will be applied to
 *      // frames of size 640 x 480 when the scaler subsystem's output size is 800 x 600.
 *      auto *in = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_input_gate_c>({{0, 640}, {1, 480}});
 *      auto *out = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_output_gate_c>({{0, 800}, {1, 600}});
 * 
 *      // Create the chain. Note that chains must begin with an input condition and end
 *      // with an output condition.
 *      std::vector<abstract_filter_c*> chain = {in, blur, flip, out};
 * 
 *      // Make the filter subsystem aware of the chain.
 *      kf_register_filter_chain(chain);
 * 
 *      // Note: VCS's display subsystem provides the end-user an interactive filter
 *      // graph for building filter chains via the GUI.
 *      @endcode
 * 
 *   5. Apply suitable filter chains to captured frames:
 *      @code
 *      kc_ev_new_captured_frame.listen([](const captured_frame_s &frame)
 *      {
 *          image_s image(frame.pixels.data, frame.r);
 *          kf_apply_matching_filter_chain(&image);
 *      });
 *      @endcode
 * 
 *   6. (Optional) Apply filters individually:
 *      @code
 *      auto *blur = kf_create_filter_instance<filter_blur_c>();
 * 
 *      // Filter a dummy image of 1 x 2 resolution (BGRA/8888 format).
 *      uint8_t pixels[8];
 *      resolution_s resolution = {1, 2, 32};
 *      blur->apply(pixels, resolution);
 * 
 *      // When we no longer need the filter.
 *      kf_delete_filter_instance(blur);
 *      @endcode
 * 
 *   7. VCS will automatically release the subsystem on program termination.
 * 
 * @warning
 * Once established, you should never change a filter's UUID. It acts as a filter
 * type identifier when VCS's filter graphs are saved to -- and loaded from -- disk.
 *
